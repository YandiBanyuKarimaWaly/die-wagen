Implement classes for vehicles using inheritance:

• A Vehicle has a name, a number of wheels, and a number of seats.

• A Car is a vehicle with at least 4 seats and 4 wheels; Additionally cars have a color.

• A Motorbike is a vehicle with 2 wheels and 1 or 2 seats.

Make sure that all data members are only accessible via get/set methods,
which write errors to the console when invalid parameters have been passed.

Vehicles shall also have a current position, which is initialized to 0;
when they drive this position is changed.

Implement a member function int drive(int dist) which advances the current position by dist
and returns it. Cars can drive forward and backward, motorbikes only forward.

Override the drive method for motorbikes, such that an error message is printed 
when a negative argument is passed for parameter dist.

Create UML and codes, make a thorough analysis of the code, mention the advantages 
and disadvantages/failure cases if any, provide output code in the console.
